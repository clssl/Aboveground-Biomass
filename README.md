File “r_gith_agdb2” is an Esri Grid dataset at 300m resolution for aboveground digestible biomass in Mg/(km^2) used for estimates in the manuscript “Assessing Contemporary Arctic Habitat Availability for a Woolly Mammoth Proxy” by Poquérusse et al. (forthcoming, 2024). 
Base data used in this manuscript and analysis is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1763 (ORNL DAAC’s Global Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon Density Maps for the Year 2010 at 300 m resolution in Northern Alaska and the Seward Peninsula), https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2032 (ORNL DAAC’s ABoVE: Modeled Top Cover by Plant Functional Type over Alaska and Yukon, 1985-2020), and https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1359 (Land Cover and Ecosystem Map Collection for Northern Alaska).
All operations were conducted in ArcGIS 10.3.1 using Map Algebra/Raster Calculator on base data and tabulated using Zonal Statistics.  
Note this file includes the aboveground digestible biomass data after applying digestibility and top cover factors but does not include the net primary productivity (NPP) and forage rate scale factors. See manuscript and supplementary materials for more details.
